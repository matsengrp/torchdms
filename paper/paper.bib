	abstract = {Multiplex assays of variant effect (MAVEs) are a family of methods that includes deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments on proteins and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) on gene regulatory sequences. However, a general strategy for inferring quantitative models of genotype-phenotype (G-P) maps from MAVE data is lacking. Here we introduce MAVE-NN, a neural-network-based Python package that implements a broadly applicable information-theoretic framework for learning G-P maps{\textemdash}including biophysically interpretable models{\textemdash}from MAVE datasets. We demonstrate MAVE-NN in multiple biological contexts, and highlight the ability of our approach to deconvolve mutational effects from otherwise confounding experimental nonlinearities and noise.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = "Genotype-phenotype relationships are notoriously complicated.
              Idiosyncratic interactions between specific combinations of
              mutations occur and are difficult to predict. Yet it is
              increasingly clear that many interactions can be understood in
              terms of global epistasis. That is, mutations may act additively
              on some underlying, unobserved trait, and this trait is then
              transformed via a nonlinear function to the observed phenotype as
              a result of subsequent biophysical and cellular processes. Here
              we infer the shape of such global epistasis in three proteins,
              based on published high-throughput mutagenesis data. To do so, we
              develop a maximum-likelihood inference procedure using a flexible
              family of monotonic nonlinear functions spanned by an I-spline
              basis. Our analysis uncovers dramatic nonlinearities in all three
              proteins; in some proteins a model with global epistasis accounts
              for virtually all of the measured variation, whereas in others we
              find substantial local epistasis as well. This method allows us
              to test hypotheses about the form of global epistasis and to
              distinguish variance components attributable to global epistasis,
              local epistasis, and measurement error.",

  abstract = "Evolutionary prediction is of deep practical and philosophical
              importance. Here we show, using a simple computational protein
              model, that protein evolution remains unpredictable, even if one
              knows the effects of all mutations in an ancestral protein
              background. We performed a virtual deep mutational scan-revealing
              the individual and pairwise epistatic effects of every mutation
              to our model protein-and then used this information to predict
              evolutionary trajectories. Our predictions were poor. This is a
              consequence of statistical thermodynamics. Proteins exist as
              ensembles of similar conformations. The effect of a mutation
              depends on the relative probabilities of conformations in the
              ensemble, which in turn, depend on the exact amino acid sequence
              of the protein. Accumulating substitutions alter the relative
              probabilities of conformations, thereby changing the effects of
              future mutations. This manifests itself as subtle but pervasive
              high-order epistasis. Uncertainty in the effect of each mutation
              accumulates and undermines prediction. Because conformational
              ensembles are an inevitable feature of proteins, this is likely

  title    = "Uninterpretable interactions: epistasis as uncertainty",
  author   = "Sailer, Zachary R and Harms, Michael J",
  abstract = "Abstract Epistasis is a common feature of genotype-phenotype
              maps. Understanding the patterns of epistasis is critical for
              predicting unmeasured phenotypes, explaining evolutionary
              trajectories, and for inferring the biological mechanisms that
              determine a map. One common approach is to use a linear model to
              decompose epistasis into specific pairwise and high-order
              interactions between mutations. Such interactions are then used
              to identify important biology or to explain how the
              genotype-phenotype map shapes evolution. Here we show that the
              coefficients extracted from such analyses are likely
              uninterpretable. They cannot be extracted reliably from
              experimental genotype-phenotype maps due to regression bias.
              Further, we can generate epistatic ``interactions''
              indistinguishable from those in experimental maps using a
              completely random process. From this, we conclude that epistasis
              should be treated as a random, but quantifiable, variation in
              these maps. This perspective allows us to build predictive models
              with known error from a small number of measured phenotypes. It
              also suggests that we need mechanistic, nonlinear models to
              account for epistasis and decompose genotype-phenotype maps.",
