## What is this?

PyTorch for Deep Mutational Scanning (`torchdms`) is a Python package made to train neural networks on amino-acid substitution data, predicting some chosen functional score(s).
We use the binary encoding of variants using [BinaryMap Object](https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_variants/dms_variants.binarymap.html) as input to feed-forward networks.
